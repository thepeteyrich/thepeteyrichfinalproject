		<h5>Peter Meets Peter</h5>
		
		<p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span> few years ago I needed a creative boost so I started sketching a series of illustrations based off of one of my favorite logos of all time; the Air Jordan Jumpman created by Peter Moore. I thought it would be fun to concept "jumpman-esque" logos for other famous people as well and it started to take off.</p>

		<p>Right now The Jumpman Series lives on social media under the hashtag #thejumpmanseries but it is slowly starting to find its way onto walls and street posts around New York City and other parts of the country. The goal is for it to be seen everywhere, across many platforms and multi-media not for my own benefit, but to inspire others just like Peter Moore did for me. It only made sense to start the series with my initial subject as both "MJ's" play such a crucial role in who I am: a kid from Philly who likes to dance and pretends he can still dunk.</p> 

		<p>Keep creating, and don't stop 'til you get enough.</p>
